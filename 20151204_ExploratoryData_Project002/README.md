### plot1.R
This program addresses the following question from the assignment:
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the 
base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each 
of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

### plot2.R
This program addresses the following question from the assignment:
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") 
from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

### plot3.R
This program addresses the following question from the assignment:
Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) 
variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999-2008 for 
Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999-2008? Use the ggplot2 
plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

### plot4.R
This program addresses the following question from the assignment:
Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed 
from 1999-2008?

### plot5.R
This program addresses the following question from the assignment:
Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed 
from 1999-2008?

### plot6.R
This program addresses the following question from the assignment:
Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor 
vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen 
greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
