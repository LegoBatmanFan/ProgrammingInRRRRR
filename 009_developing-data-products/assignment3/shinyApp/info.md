This shiny app was created as a requirement for Coursera's Developing Data Products course by Lena Horsley (Completed: 3 March 2020)


* The data set used for this project can be found at the 
[Chicago Crime Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2017/d62x-nvdr). I discovered this data set while watching the [MTV True Crime - Tragic Accident or Calculated Murder?](http://www.mtv.com/episodes/602t8f/true-life-crime-tragic-accident-or-calculated-murder-season-1-ep-101) episode, which explored the circumstances surrounding the death of Kenneka Jenkins. 

* The code for this app can be found [here](https://github.com/LegoBlackPanther/developingdataproducts/tree/master/assignment3).
